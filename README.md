# Rocky Mountain Tails — Dog Walking Website (assignment 2 Java Script)

Hi there! This is a portfolio project as well as the my assignment #2 project to be graded on that I built as part of my web development learning journey with the help from my professor, codeacademy, webMD, and chat gpt.

This folder contains a multi-page website called **Rocky Mountain Tails**, a fictional dog-walking and sitting service based in the mountains. The site includes a homepage, service descriptions, a booking form with dynamic interactivity, and a team section featuring our furry clients and besties (aka dog walkers).
