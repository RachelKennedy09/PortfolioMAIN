# 🐾 Rocky Mountain Tails — Dog Walking Website

Hi there! This is a portfolio project I built as part of my web development learning journey.

This folder contains a multi-page website called **Rocky Mountain Tails**, a fictional dog-walking and sitting service based in the mountains. The site includes a homepage, service descriptions, a booking form with dynamic interactivity, and a team section featuring our furry clients and besties (aka dog walkers).
