<!-- SUMMARY OF MAKING THIS WEBSITE
 I started this autobiography right when we started the class. It started off very basic, I wish i saved
 what it looked like before, but i remember, and in a year from now i will look at these projects
 and see how far i have come.
 
 I learned a lot of foundations of softwre tha tlead me to be able to make 
 my portfolio and this website, a lot of help from chat gpt and copying off of dev tools to see how they did it
 although with the dev tools there is still a lot i dont understand which i believe will
 come with java script(I will make a different project for learnign java script so i can see how 
 much i learn) 
 
 Sometimes I feel like a fraud but it also takes skill to be able to copy a website 
 as well as know what to ask gpt when you need help (THAT HAS TO BE A SKILL RIGHT?!)

 So, with that being said, I am proud that I could make this type of website because, less 
 than 1 month ago, I didnt even know what CSS was!!!!!!

 The more practice I do the better I wil become at not needing help, especially 
 if i want to be a pro at debugging and writing code. But I will keep practicing!

                        <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>

                        <p>
                            Tash Sultana has never followed the script. The multi-instrumentalist, engineer, producer,
                            singer-songwriter, and entrepreneur has built an extraordinary career on their own terms—one
                            defined by boundless creativity, relentless determination, and an unshakable connection to
                            their
                            craft.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            From their early days busking on Melbourne’s streets to commanding global stages and
                            amassing
                            billions of streams, Tash has forged a career built on innovation, authenticity, and
                            undeniable
                            talent.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The story began with a single spark: a guitar gifted by their grandfather at age three. From
                            that moment, Tash’s world became music. Over the years, they taught themselves to play over
                            a
                            dozen instruments, becoming a one-person orchestra whose groundbreaking looping skills set
                            them
                            apart.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            They even designed their own loop station with a trusted team to take technical pioneering
                            to a
                            whole new level. By 2016, their debut release, the <strong>Notion EP</strong>, catapulted
                            them
                            to global stardom—amassing millions of streams and producing multi-platinum singles like
                            <em>Jungle</em> and <em>Notion</em>. Viral live bedroom recordings nearly broke the
                            internet.
                            But it was their first full-length album, <strong>Flow State</strong>, that truly introduced
                            the
                            world to an artist with a vision like no other. The album featured platinum singles like
                            <em>Mystik</em> and gold-certified hits including <em>Murder to the Mind</em>,
                            <em>Salvation</em>, and <em>Free Mind</em>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 2021, Tash’s sophomore album, <strong>Terra Firma</strong>, marked a new era of growth.
                            Debuting at #1 on the ARIA charts, it paired introspective lyricism with lush, immersive
                            soundscapes. It also earned them the Rolling Stone Australia Award for Best Single with
                            <em>Pretty Lady</em>. Their <em>MTV Unplugged: Live in Melbourne</em> album offered fans an
                            intimate glimpse into their artistry—self-produced, engineered, and mixed entirely at their
                            own
                            Lonely Lands Studio. The performance became the most-watched Unplugged session in the
                            Aus-Pacific region, reaching over 180 million people worldwide.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 2023, the <strong>SUGAR EP</strong> captured another side of Tash’s evolution. Named
                            after
                            the emotional effects of ADHD medication (“artificial happiness”), the project explored
                            upbeat
                            sounds and heartfelt lyricism. Tracks like <em>James Dean</em> and <em>Bitter Lovers</em>
                            (featuring BJ The Chicago Kid) blended genre-fluid soundscapes with experimental intent.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Beyond the music, Tash expanded their role as an entrepreneur. They founded <strong>Lonely
                                Lands
                                Agency</strong>, <strong>Lonely Lands Studio</strong>, and launched <strong>Lonely Lands
                                Liquids</strong> and the <strong>I Am Me Foundation</strong>—projects rooted in
                            independence, authenticity, and support for emerging creatives.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, in 2025, Tash embarks on a new chapter with the release of <strong>Milk &
                                Honey</strong>—a
                            deeply personal single that reflects on their humble beginnings as a looper. The track
                            explores
                            fulfillment, fame, and the peace found in simplicity, all wrapped in Tash’s signature
                            genre-bending style and busker roots.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With a career spanning over a decade, Tash’s accomplishments speak volumes: selling out
                            shows at
                            iconic venues like <em>Red Rocks Amphitheatre</em> (in just five minutes), headlining major
                            festivals, achieving 15 ARIA nominations, and winning the 2023 <strong>Rolling Stone Global
                                Artist Award</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Yet for Tash, the journey is far from over. With their drive to push creative boundaries and
                            a
                            growing legacy as an artist, entrepreneur, and mentor, Tash Sultana continues to shape the
                            music
                            industry on their own terms—boldly, authentically, and unapologetically.
